Dear customer,

The Exactive Series Application Programming Interface (ESAPI) allows to access Thermo Fisher Scientific mass spectrometers programmatically.

Using the interface requires licenses which may be part of the regular instrument software distribution or which have to be obtained as a collaborator.

ESAPI.chm is a help file describing this interface in the well-known format of Microsoft.

ESAPI.msha/ESAPI.mshc contain the same content in the new format useful for Visual Studio 2010, etc.
Install_ESAPI.bat, Remove_ESAPI.bat and HelpLibraryManagerLauncher.exe are helper to install this new format.


Best regards,
Thermo Fisher Scientific, 2014 (FGC)
